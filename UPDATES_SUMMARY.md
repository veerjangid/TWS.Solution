## Implementation Checklist

When starting implementation, developers must:

### IRA Features
- [ ] Create `IRAAccountType` enum with exactly 5 values
- [ ] DO NOT create `IRAType` enum
- [ ] Use same 5 types for initial selection and General Info
- [ ] Verify database constraint matches enum

### Offering Features
- [ ] Create `OfferingStatus` enum with exactly 3 values
- [ ] Use "Raising" as default status
- [ ] Primary field named "OfferingName"
- [ ] Verify database constraint matches enum

### Investment Relationships
- [ ] Implement `InvestorInvestments` junction table
- [ ] Add unique constraint on (InvestorId, OfferingId)
- [ ] Support many-to-many relationship

### Request Account
- [ ] Implement exactly as specified in BusinessRequirement.md section 3.1
- [ ] No additional fields beyond documented ones

## Documentation Hierarchy (For Conflicts)

**Order of Precedence** (highest to lowest):

1. **CLARIFICATIONS.md** - Most authoritative
2. **BusinessRequirement.md** (with clarifications section)
3. **DatabaseSchema.md** (with clarifications section)
4. **FunctionalRequirement.md** (updated)
5. **ROADMAP.md** (updated)
6. **APIDoc.md**
7. Other documents

If any conflict arises, refer to documents in this order.

## Verification Commands

After implementation starts:

```bash
# Verify enums are created correctly
ls TWS.Core/Enums/

# Should see:
# - IRAAccountType.cs (5 values)
# - OfferingStatus.cs (3 values)
# - NO IRAType.cs file

# Build and verify no errors
dotnet build

# Check enum values match documentation
grep -r "IRAAccountType" TWS.Core/Enums/
grep -r "OfferingStatus" TWS.Core/Enums/
```
